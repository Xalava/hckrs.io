How city redirects works
=====================

set meteor ROOT_URL:
http://hckrs.io

set DNS forwarding:
hckrs.io -> www.hckrs.io

set DNS CNAME record:
*.hckrs.io -> http://hckrs.heroku-app.com

Server-side code recognizes that subdomain 'www' is a special city.
And tries to redirect the user to the closest subdomain.
e.g. http://lyon.hckrs.io

Client-side the website store the current city name 'lyon' in 
a session variable. You can access it by calling:
Session.get('currentCity');

set DNS CNAME record:
*.staging.hckrs.io -> http://hckrs-staging.heroku-app.com

set meteor ROOT_URL:
http://local1.hckrs.io

set DNS forwarding:
local1.hckrs.io -> www.local1.hckrs.io

set DNS CNAME record:
*.local1.hckrs.io -> http://MY-LOCAL-IP
