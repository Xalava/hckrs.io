LOCAL DNS
===========

SOURCE:

http://www.echoditto.com/blog/never-touch-your-local-etchosts-file-os-x-again


DESCRIPTION:

Install 'dnsmasq' and configure to create a local DNS server. 
The configuration used below will point top-level domains ".dev" to your local system.

So that we can develop locally using:
http://hckrs.dev:3000 (notice .dev extension)



INSTALL & CONFIGURE
===================

Run the following commands in the terminal.
The 4th command will request to enter your password.


brew install dnsmasq
mkdir -pv $(brew --prefix)/etc/
echo 'address=/.dev/127.0.0.1' > $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo cp -v $(brew --prefix dnsmasq)/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/dev'



HOW TO RUN
==========

Start meteor with the following command:

ROOT_URL=http://hckrs.dev:3000 mrt --settings settings-local.json

Alternatively, you can start the meteor by running the app via /tools/meteor-run.app
You can even put that app in your dock :-)
