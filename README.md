No need to be a developer to contribute. Different skills will come in handy, maybe you are good in ***design, brainstorm, being social, hack, game, interaction or sales***.
It's also okay to just start developing (making changes to this repo). Feel free to work on issues or add your own. Do a pull request at the end to integrate your improvements. 

Would you like to be involved, please contact toon@hckrs.io.
